The C Programming Language is written by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. As C is one of the most important programming languages in the world, this book give clear explanation on the fundamentals of programming and provide a solid foundation for anyone who wants to learn how to code in object-oriented programming in the future. 

This book provides me a great foundation to learn the funndamentals of programming. Each section is explained in a simple and concise way and the exercises are challenging. But, they helps to excel me to become a better programmer.

I've learnt the fundamentals of programming such as variable types, operators, escape sequence, control flow functions, basics of functions, recursion, pointers , arrays, structures, input and output, stack and heap and some C libraries.

In this repository, you will find the exercises and examples code that I practice from this book.
